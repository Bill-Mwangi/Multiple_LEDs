Multiple_LEDs
Connect each of the positive terminals of the LEDs to one digital output port
 on your board and the negative terminals in series with a 330 Ohms resistor.
The resistors should terminate in common ground connection across the breadboard
 from where the common ground is connected to the ground terminal of the board.
Upload the code to the board and watch the LEDs light up.
